# Phone-Number-Validator
A tool that allows you to easily correct invalid phone numbers.

Country phone numbers supported: Australia, Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, North America, Poland, Spain, South Africa, Switzerland, Vanuatu.

To start using, install and go to http://{yoursite}/civicrm/phonenumbervalidator

This doesn't perform any validation upon entry, and won't automatically change your data.

This was rebuilt from the earlier UK Phone Number Validator, and has been completely overhauled to use the API, Unit Tests, and a better underlying structure.
